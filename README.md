# Snake-Game (My Third Game)
TypeScript-coded game with Visual Studio Code

My version of the classic Snake game.

Link to game: http://apps.introcs.com/bchaudhari/Game3/snake.html

Challenges with the game:
- Getting the snake to move through the map as if it was a grid, that is, from block to block
- Having the snake's body follow the snake's head in the same fashion as the classic game
- Adding a new block to the snake's body at the correct position when the snake consumes the food
